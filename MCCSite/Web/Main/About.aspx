                Our history</h4>
            <p>
                Miramar Community Crèche was established in 1985 and operated in the Miramar Community
                Centre until December 2000. We opened our purpose-built crèche facilities in January
                2001 after many months of volunteer work by a dedicated and committed group of parents
                and staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crèche is managed by a Manager and Advisory Committee made up of parents, and
                is a non-profit organisation with Incorporated society status. Parental involvement
                is crucial to the smooth running of the crèche and involvement at committee level
                is encouraged and valued.</p>
            <p>
                The crèche is licensed by the Ministry of Education for up to 25 children and 4
                Teachers per session, although we generally only have up to 22 children enrolled
                as we aim to provide a quality environment for the children. The crèche is financed
                by bulk funding from the Ministry of Education and session fees paid by the parents.</p>

                Age of Child starting crèche</h4>
            <p>
                As a general rule, we prefer children to be 12 months old before attending crèche.
                We are licensed for 5 children under 2 years of age per session. As we have a waiting
                list operating we suggest parents enrol their children early. Children can be enrolled
                from birth.</p>

                Opening hours</h4>
            <p>
                The crèche operates throughout the year:</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><span class="bold">Monday - Friday</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.45am-1.30pm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The crèche closes for 5-6 weeks at the end of the year. We do not open on public
                holidays or statutory holidays.</p>
            <p>
                The Teachers are available at crèche from 8.30am before each session and until 2.00pm,
                Monday-Friday.</p>

                Excursions/trips</h4>
            <p>
                From time to time we plan excursions/outings for the children, e.g. Fire Station
                or Rescue Helicopter base, etc. We seek parent’s permission before we take the children
                on outings. We often go on short walks or visit the Chelsea St. Park behind the
                crèche. If you do not want your child involved in park visits please let us know.</p>
