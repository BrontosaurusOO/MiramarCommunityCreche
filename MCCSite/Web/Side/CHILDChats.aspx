<h2>C.H.I.L.D. Chats</h2>

<p>Our plan is to provide parents with opportunities to participate in formal discussions about their child, focusing on sharing information about their child and their family and their learning and development.</p>

<div class="centered">
    <img alt="C.H.I.L.D Chat" src="/Images/childchatlogo.png" height="250px" width="250px"/>
</div>

<p><strong>C.H.I.L.D </strong>To encourage <strong>C</strong>ollaboration between <strong>H</strong>ome and 
the <strong>I</strong>ndividual child’s <strong>L</strong>earning and <strong>D</strong>evelopment.</p>

<p >Do you want an opportunity to participate in a formal
discussion about your child with the Teachers?</p>

<p >Do you want to share information about your child
and their learning and development?</p>

<p >Do you want to know about your child’s time at crèche,
what they spend time doing and 
what their interests at crèche are?</p>

<p >The Teachers are available to get together with you to talk about your child.
The Chat will be roughly 20 minutes long.</p>

<p >
<strong>The C.H.I.L.D. Chats can be held either:</strong>

<ul>
    <li> At crèche or in your child’s home</li>
    <li> In the afternoon or in the evening, depending on your preference.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p >
The Teachers will share your child’s Individual Profile with you.
Parents will be requested to fill out a “CHILD Chat”
sheet before the get together.</p>

<p >
Please let one of the Teachers know if you are interested
in setting up a C.H.I.L.D. Chat time.</p>
