                Mat Time (Together Time)</h4>
            <p>
                We have a regular format to the sessions, which includes a “Together Time”. This
                usually begins at 11.45am and although it is not compulsory we encourage all children
                to participate. Our aim for “Together time” is to develop the children’s language,
                literature, and listening skills through songs, stories, news, chats and introductions
                of new children. Lunch time follows Together Time. We also offer <a href="#myModal"
                    data-toggle="modal" class="text-large">‘Mako’ and ‘Pipi’</a> groups which allow
                children in specific age groups to focus on an activity appropriate to their age.</p>

                Morning Tea</h4>
            <p>
                At our crèche we have a set time for morning tea at 10.00am each session. Children
                are to bring in a healthy lunchbox and drink bottle with their name on it. Designated
                tables are used and children are encouraged to be as independent as possible. Our
                aim is to encourage self-help skills that are appropriate for the age of each child.
                All children must wash their hands before eating and the Teachers ensure that children
                only eat their own food. Nutritious meals are important. No sweets, peanut butter
                or Nutella or peanut-based foods please due to a number of children with food allergies.
                Please inform us if your child has any food allergies or any foods that you do not
                want your child eating as we often do cooking activities with the children.</p>

                News time</h4>
            <p>
                If your child would like to bring something special from home to share with the
                other children for news then we have a basket in the office for all news items and
                we would appreciate them being named if possible and placed in the basket when your
                child arrives at crèche. The basket will be brought out during session by the teacher
                and the children are invited to share their news on the mat, usually after lunch.
                Once news time is finished we place the items back in the basket and put the basket
                in the office for safe keeping of our children's special items.</p>

                From time to time we organise special visitors to the crèche that enhance our programme
                e.g. S.P.C.A., Fire engine & Officers, Ambulance, Police, Dental Nurse, Public Health
                Nurses, etc. We monitor the presence of visitors to ensure that the children are
                safe and there is a visitors book to sign.</p>

            <p>
                These are the National ECE guidelines, which the crèche programme is based on. It
                encompasses 4 principles: Family and Community, Holistic Development, Empowerment,
                and Relationships, which concentrate on developing the child’s sense of belonging,
                well-being, contribution, communication and exploration of the environment. It is
                our guide for providing and achieving a quality programme appropriate for your child.
                Copies of Te Whariki are available at the crèche for parents to take home to read.</p>
