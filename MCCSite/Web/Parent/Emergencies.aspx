                The Teachers will take any action necessary to keep the children safe in the event
                of any medical emergency. You will be contacted as soon as possible. In the event
                of a natural emergency please refer to the procedures displayed on the crèche noticeboard
                or in our policy folder which is located above the signin register.</p>

                Earthquake & Evacuation procedures</h4>
            <p>
                Please see our <a href="/Files/Emergencyprocedandplan.doc" > Emergency Plan & Procedures Policy</a>, to see how well prepared we are
                for a Civil Defence Emergency. In the event of an earthquake, teachers will call
                out “Drop, Cover, Hold” and role model the correct position for the children to
                copy. If an emergency evacuation is deemed necessary, the CD Warden will quickly
                assess if the planned evacuation route is free from hazards and inform staff of
                evacuation action to be taken. The aim is to get all children and staff to the suggested
                nearest tsunami safe zone, halfway up the hill path from Miramar Avenue to Otaki
                Street. Once there, the CD Warden will assess if there is a need to continue to
                even higher ground. We have provisions stored at a teachers home in Athens St, just
                in case they are needed. A notice notifying authorities and families of the exact
                evacuation location will be posted on the door at crèche, also at each subsequent
                evacuation location, if it is necessary to move again.</p>

                Each child must supply an emergency blanket and yearly, we will be asking for all
                parents to donate an item of food for our civil defence emergency kit. For further
                details, please refer to the civil defence information in the Induction Pack.</p>
