            <p>
                Please do not bring your child to crèche if he/she is unwell. We do not have the
                necessary facilities to care for sick children. We would appreciate a telephone
                call to let us know that your child is unwell. If your child becomes unwell while
                at crèche we will contact you and request that you collect your child. Please refer
                to our policy on illness/sickness.</p>

                We have a separate policy regarding the procedures for children who require a rest
                or sleep. We have 2 beds available for children to use and ample bed linen, which
                gets changed after every use. Please talk to the Teachers regarding your child’s
                particular rest or sleep needs. The crèche quiet room is set aside for children
                who need to rest or sleep.</p>

                Please give us a <strong>minimum of 3 weeks notice</strong> prior to withdrawing
                your child from crèche. This then allows us to fill the vacancy as soon as possible.
                Leaving forms are available by Attendance register Bay. Please refer to the terms
                and conditions of the crèche Fees brochure for further information or contact the

                If your child is going to be absent from any session please telephone the crèche
                as soon as possible and preferably before 8.45am. on that day. Please refer to the
                “Payment of Fees” terms and conditions for information regarding payment of sessions
                when children are absent. If your child is going to be away for longer than 3 weeks
                please come and talk to the Senior teacher or manager if you wish your child to
                remain on the roll. For more information see our <a href="/fees.aspx">crèche

            <h4>
                Behaviour Management</h4>
            <p>
                The crèche has a behaviour management policy in place which parents are most welcome
                to read. The principles of the policy are that each child will be treated with respect,
                dignity, promote a sense of belonging and well-being, and each child is given positive
                guidance for appropriate behaviour which recognises the child’s developmental stages
                and age.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no physical ill-treatment, solitary confinement, deprivation of food or
                drink. The Teachers aim to be fair and consistent in their approach. Our policy
                also states that “no parent is to physically punish, hit their child or another
                child while at crèche”.

                Please let us know when you have a change of address or telephone number. This is
                important in case we need to get hold of you in an emergency. These details are
                kept by the Teachers and Manager.</p>
