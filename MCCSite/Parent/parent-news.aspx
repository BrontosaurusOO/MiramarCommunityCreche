                Distribution Pockets</h4>
            <p>
                Your child will be allocated a named pocket on the red hessian display pocket system.
                This will be shown to you when your child begins at crèche. Fee invoices are issued
                into these pockets along with any newsnotes or notices for you. Please remember
                to check this pocket every session.</p>

            <p>
                Please take the time to read the information on the crèche noticeboards. Information
                about civil defence procedures, Teachers Profiles, Term dates, a copy of our licence
                etc are displayed on these noticeboards. We also have a daily whiteboard where daily
                notices and information are written. Please check this noticeboard every session
                as it often has important information.</p>

                The Manager/Advisory Committee also has a noticeboard, which they display the current
                minutes of meetings, agendas, monthly financial reports and monthly Teachers reports.
                We also have a washing roster which requires parents to take home washing possibly
                2 to 3 times in the year.
