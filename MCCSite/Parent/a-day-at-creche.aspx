            <h4>
                Primary Caregiver</h4>
            <p>
                When your child first starts crèche to help them settle in and feel a sense of security
                and belonging we will offer each child a teacher as their primary caregiver.</p>
            <p>
                The child and parent may choose a teacher that the child feels a bond with during
                their pre-visits at crèche to support them through the separation process when the
                parent leaves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Lunch Boxes & Drink Bottles</h4>
            <p>
                Please provide morning tea, lunch and a drink in a named container. Lunch-boxes
                and drink bottles are to be placed on the portable shelf unit in the kitchen. Yoghurts,
                meat and food requiring heating should be placed in the fridge. Please no peanut-butter
                or nutella sandwiches or any kind of nuts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Clothing</h4>
            <p>
                Please ensure that your child wears old clothes to crèche so that he/she can enjoy
                messy/creative play. You will need to provide a spare set of named clothing in a
                named bag for your child. Also sun-hat, sunblock in summer and coat, hat in winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your child requires nappies please supply disposable nappies and one container
                of wet wipes every 2 months. We have a supply of spare clothes that we use. Please
                return these items cleaned to the crèche as soon as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Sun sense</h4>
            <p>
                We strongly encourage the use of sunscreen and sunhats during the summer. Please
                bring a named sunhat along to crèche. Children and teachers are required to wear
                a hat outside during the months of October to April.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Toys</h4>
            <p>
                We prefer your child not to bring any toys from home to the crèche in case they
                get lost or broken. Comforters, such as a special cloth are acceptable while your
                child is settling in. Our crèche is a “war-toy free zone”. This does not apply to
                toys brought in for news time and are placed in the news basket in the office.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Art Work</h4>
            <p>
                Your child has their own named art folder where we store their dry paintings and
                artwork. Please check their folder regularly. The folders are kept in a plastic
                crate, which is usually kept by the entrance/exit door below the child's pocket.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <h4>
                Celebrations</h4>
            <p>
                At crèche we celebrate each child's birthday. We feel it is important for a small
                child to feel loved and share it with their friends. Please feel welcome to bring
                in a cake or something to celebrate with.</p>
            <p>
                If nothing is provided by the family we will provide the child with a playdough
                cake and let them blow out some candles. If you have any questions or concerns please
                get in contact with us.</p>
